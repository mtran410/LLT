Game play:
Once you're inside a room and the game has begun, you'll notice a few things. Firstly your health bar and avatar will be displayed prominently at the top of the screen, above that of your teammates.  The object of the game is to deplete the enemy’s health bars by shining your flashlight at the enemy’s phones (simulating laser tag).  Once a players health bar is depleted, that player is out for the rest of the game, and must wait for the host to start another round of Local Laser Tag. The last team to still have "alive" players wins. In the event that the time runs out before a team has won, the team with the least number of deaths will be the winner and the round will be over.
WARNING:
Do not shine lights at individual’s faces per damage to retina.   Yes, team damage is on, so careful where you point that thing. The creators of Local Laser Tag are not responsible for any death, injury, loss of vision, broken property or any other mishap what so ever that may occur while playing Local Laser Tag.
